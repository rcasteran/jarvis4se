# Requirement analysis

Requirement analysis is the systematic examination of a [goal](broken-reference) expressed by at least one stakeholder to identify all the [requirement](broken-reference)s the [system ](broken-reference)must satisfy to achieve it.

From a methodological point of view:

* A goal is achieved by an [activity](broken-reference) that can be performed by the [system](broken-reference), an [actor](broken-reference) or an [enabling system](broken-reference). If the goal cannot be achieved by a single activity, then it can be refined into different subgoals up to identify an activity for each subgoal in the [operational analysis](operational-analysis.md). Either goal is satisfied if all subgoals are satisfied (AND-decomposition) or goal is satisfied if at least one subgoal is satisfied (OR-decomposition)
* A goal can be in conflict with another goal: in this case only one of the two goals can be achieved by an activity
* A requirement is specifying a behavior or a quality of the activity to be perfomed to achieve a goal. A requirement that specifies a behavior or a quality of an activity performed by the system can be derived into different subrequirements up to identify a system element in the [physical architecture definition](physical-architecture-definition.md).
