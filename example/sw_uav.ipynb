    "The second problem is described in [1, 56] and it deals with __Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)__ also called drone. The degree of autonomy of these systems evolves progressively from the tracking of a trajectory defined by an operator to a complete autonomy.\n",

    "In the case of trajectory tracking, a key functionality of the UAV is its ability __to detect obstacles__ and __plan a new trajectory__ that will allow it to avoid the UAV while continuing its path to the desired destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function composed of __obstacle detection__, __decision making__ and __calculation of a new trajectory__ must be ensured by the drone alone, without intervention from the ground station, in order to gain in efficiency.\n",

    "It must also be optimized to adapt to the drone’s energy resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __obstacle detection and avoidance functionality__ is provided by a __platform (HW) using a heterogeneous multi-core architecture (SHMC processor)__, which allows the UAV to have a high computing power while reducing its energy consumption (compared to a single-core or homogeneous multi-core processor).\n",

    "The SHMC processor is composed of cores with different computing power but using the same instruction set.\n",
